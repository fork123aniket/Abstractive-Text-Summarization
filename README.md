# Abstractive Text Summarization

This repository aims at proving ***Stacked LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder*** implementation for ***Abstactive Text Summarization*** task, which generates new relevant sentence as summary for each input (original text in the form of longer paragraphs).
This task has many applications:-
- Entity timelines - Given an entity and a time period, provide a summary of the most memorable events involving this entity.
- Sentence Compression - Given a sentence, generate a shorter one while preserving the essential contextual information.
- Summarization of User Generated Content - Identify main aspects and summarize for machine or user consumption.

## Requirements
- `Tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `NLTK`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`

## Usage
### Data
- The developed model is trained on the ***Amazon Fine Food reviews*** dataset, which can be downloaded from [***here***](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).
- The data spans a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012.
- These reviews include product and user information, ratings, plain text review, and summary.
- It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories.
### Training and Testing
To train the model and generate summary for each new test paragraph, run `Abstractive_Text_Summarization.py`.

## Results
Following are a few summaries generated by the model:-
